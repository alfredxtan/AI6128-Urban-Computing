This project requires us to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Visualize raw GPS points from trajectory data (spatiotemporal) overlayed onto the road network of Porto.
2. Perform map matching to map trajectory data to the road network.
3. Analyze the results and apply them to gather insights.
4. Suggest improvements to the map matching algorithm.

Detailed project description can be found here, together with the report.
