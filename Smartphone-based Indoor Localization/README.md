This project requires us to perform the following tasks:

1. Preprocess and analyze the data collected from the various sensors.
2. Visualize data collected from the sensors as on overlay on the floor-plan.
3. Using the other sensor data, construct a robust waypoint visualization (i.e., fingerprint) to localize the user.
4. Optionally, employ a deep network to refine the fingerprinting.
